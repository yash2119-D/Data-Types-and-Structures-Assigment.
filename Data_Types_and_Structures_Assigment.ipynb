        "## Q - 1. What are data structures, and why are they important ?\n",
        "- Data structures are specialized ways to organize, manage, and store data in a computer so it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They provide a foundation for creating efficient algorithms and applications by optimizing resource use, such as memory and processing time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Types of Data Structures:\n",
        "1. **Linear Data Structures**:\n",
        "   - **Array**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.\n",
        "   - **Linked List**: A series of connected nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.\n",
        "   - **Stack**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure used for operations like backtracking.\n",
        "   - **Queue**: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) structure used in tasks like scheduling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**:\n",
        "   - **Trees**: Hierarchical structures like binary trees or binary search trees for hierarchical data representation.\n",
        "   - **Graphs**: Nodes connected by edges, used to represent networks.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Hash-Based Structures**:\n",
        "   - **Hash Tables**: Provide efficient data retrieval using a key-value mapping.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Other Structures**:\n",
        "   - **Heap**: A specialized tree-based structure used in priority queues.\n",
        "   - **Trie**: Used to store strings, often for searching autocomplete or dictionary-like data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of Data Structures:\n",
        "1. **Efficiency**: They enable efficient data processing, retrieval, and manipulation.\n",
        "   - Example: Searching for an element in a **binary search tree** is faster than in an unsorted array.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Scalability**: They make programs scalable by optimizing resource use.\n",
        "   - Example: A **hash table** allows near-instantaneous lookup even for large datasets.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Data Organization**: They allow structured storage to model real-world relationships.\n",
        "   - Example: A **graph** is ideal for representing a social network.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Algorithm Implementation**: Most algorithms are based on specific data structures.\n",
        "   - Example: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths uses a **priority queue** (implemented using a heap).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Problem Solving**: Different structures fit different scenarios.\n",
        "   - Example: A **queue** is perfect for breadth-first search (BFS), while a **stack** is used for depth-first search (DFS).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Software Design**: They form the backbone of many system designs, from operating systems to databases.\n",
        "\n",

        "  - The difference between **mutable** and **immutable** data types lies in whether their values can be modified after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Mutable Data Types**\n",
        "- **Definition**: These data types allow modifications (add, remove, or update elements) after the object is created.\n",
        "- **Behavior**: Changes directly affect the original object, without creating a new one.\n",

        "    my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the list\n",
        "    print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  - **Dictionaries**: You can update key-value pairs.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Immutable Data Types**\n",
        "- **Definition**: These data types do **not** allow modifications after the object is created. Any operation that attempts to change the value creates a new object.\n",
        "- **Behavior**: The original object remains unchanged, and a new object is created if a modification is attempted.\n",

        "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "    # my_tuple[0] = 0  # This will raise a TypeError\n",

        "\n",
        "## Q - 4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "  - Dictionaries in Python store data as **key-value pairs** using a **hash table** under the hood. This design allows for fast data retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations, typically with \\( O(1) \\) average time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Dictionaries Store Data\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hashing**:\n",
        "   - Each key in a dictionary is passed through a **hashing function** to generate a unique hash value (an integer).\n",
        "   - This hash value determines where the key-value pair is stored in the dictionary's underlying data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Buckets**:\n",
        "   - The dictionary uses an array-like structure called a **hash table** or **bucket array**.\n",
        "   - Each slot (or \"bucket\") in this array corresponds to a hash value, and it stores the key-value pair at the computed index.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Collisions**:\n",
        "   - If two keys produce the same hash value (a phenomenon called a **hash collision**), Python uses a **collision resolution strategy**.\n",
        "     - Typically, it uses **open addressing** or **chaining** to store multiple key-value pairs in the same bucket without overwriting.\n",
        "     - In Python dictionaries, **open addressing** is used with probing to find an alternative location in the table for the new key-value pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Resizing**:\n",
        "   - Dictionaries dynamically resize when their load factor (the ratio of stored elements to the total number of buckets) exceeds a threshold.\n",
        "   - Resizing involves creating a larger hash table and rehashing all existing keys to redistribute them.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Key Requirements**:\n",
        "   - Keys in a dictionary must be **hashable** (i.e., immutable and implement the `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods).\n",
        "   - Examples of valid keys: strings, numbers, tuples (with immutable elements).\n",
        "   - Invalid keys: mutable types like lists or other dictionaries.\n",

        "## Q - 5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python ?\n",
        "  - You might use a **set** instead of a **list** in Python when you need **unique elements** and require **fast membership testing**. Sets are optimized for these use cases, while lists are more general-purpose.\n",

        "### Reasons to Use a Set Instead of a List:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Uniqueness**:\n",
        "   - Sets automatically remove duplicate elements.\n",
        "   - If you have a collection where duplicates are not allowed, a set is the ideal choice.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3]\n",
        "     my_set = set(my_list)\n",
        "     print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Fast Membership Testing**:\n",
        "   - Sets offer **O(1)** average time complexity for membership tests (`in` or `not in`), thanks to their hash table implementation.\n",
        "   - Lists, in contrast, have **O(n)** complexity because they require linear search.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "     print(2 in my_set)  # Fast: True\n",
        "     \n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     print(2 in my_list)  # Slower for large lists: True\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Set Operations**:\n",
        "   - Sets support mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference, which are not natively available for lists.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "     set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
        "     print(set1 & set2)  # Intersection: {3}\n",
        "     print(set1 | set2)  # Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
        "     print(set1 - set2)  # Difference: {1, 2}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Performance for Large Data**:\n",
        "   - For large datasets where operations like de-duplication, membership testing, or mathematical set operations are frequent, sets are significantly faster than lists.\n",

        "## Q - 7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python ?\n",
        "  - Tuples ensure **data integrity** in Python by being **immutable**. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability provides several benefits, particularly for scenarios where data consistency and safety are crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Ways Tuples Ensure Data Integrity**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Immutability**:\n",
        "   - Tuples cannot be modified after creation. This ensures that the data remains constant throughout its lifecycle, preventing accidental or intentional changes.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "     # my_tuple[0] = 10  # Raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - This makes tuples ideal for storing data that must remain consistent, such as configurations, database keys, or constants.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hashability**:\n",
        "   - Tuples are hashable if they contain only hashable elements (e.g., numbers, strings, or other tuples). This allows tuples to be used as **keys in dictionaries** and elements in sets, ensuring data relationships remain intact.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_dict = {(\"x\", \"y\"): 100}\n",
        "     print(my_dict[(\"x\", \"y\")])  # Output: 100\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Predictability in Shared Contexts**:\n",
        "   - Tuples can be shared across threads or processes without the risk of their contents being altered, ensuring reliable and predictable behavior in concurrent or multi-threaded programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consistency in Data Structures**:\n",
        "   - Tuples can safely represent fixed-size collections, such as coordinate pairs, RGB values, or database records, without risk of size or structure alteration.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     rgb_color = (255, 0, 0)  # Represents red color\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Reduced Side Effects**:\n",
        "   - When passing a tuple to a function, there is no risk of unintended side effects, as the tuple cannot be modified.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     def process_data(data):\n",
        "         # Attempting to modify will raise an error\n",
        "         # data[0] = 0  # TypeError\n",
        "         return sum(data)\n",
        "     \n",
        "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "     print(process_data(my_tuple))  # Output: 6\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Encapsulation of Immutable Data**:\n",
        "   - Tuples are an ideal choice when encapsulating data that must not change during the program's execution, enforcing integrity by design.\n",

        "  ```python\n",
        "  CONFIG = (\"DEBUG\", \"VERSION\", \"DATABASE_URL\")\n",

        "## Q - 8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python ?\n",
        "  - A **hash table** is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a **hashing function** to compute an index for each key, enabling fast retrieval of values. It provides average \\( O(1) \\) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, making it highly efficient for many applications.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **How a Hash Table Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hashing Function**:\n",
        "   - A hashing function takes a key and converts it into a fixed-size integer (the hash value).\n",
        "   - This hash value determines the index (or \"bucket\") where the key-value pair will be stored in the hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Buckets**:\n",
        "   - A bucket is a slot in the hash table where one or more key-value pairs can be stored. Each bucket corresponds to a specific hash value.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Collision Handling**:\n",
        "   - **Collisions** occur when multiple keys produce the same hash value. Python handles collisions using **open addressing**, where an alternative index is computed to find an empty slot for storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Resizing**:\n",
        "   - Hash tables dynamically grow in size when they reach a certain load factor (e.g., 2/3 full). Resizing involves creating a larger table and rehashing all existing keys to redistribute them across the new table.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How Dictionaries Use Hash Tables**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, dictionaries leverage hash tables for their efficient key-value storage. Here's how the relationship works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Key Hashing**:\n",
        "   - When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, Python computes the hash of the key using the `hash()` function.\n",
        "   - The hash value determines the bucket index in the hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Key Uniqueness**:\n",
        "   - The hash table ensures that each key is unique within the dictionary. If a new key hashes to the same value as an existing key, the collision is resolved, and the new key is stored in an alternate bucket.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fast Lookups**:\n",
        "   - When accessing a value, Python computes the hash of the provided key, identifies the corresponding bucket, and retrieves the value, making lookups very fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Immutable Keys**:\n",
        "   - Keys in dictionaries must be immutable and hashable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples). Mutable objects like lists cannot be used as keys because their hash values could change, causing inconsistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example of a Dictionary in Python**\n",

        "## Q - 10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "  - Strings in Python are **immutable**, meaning once a string is created, its content cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string object. This immutability is a deliberate design choice in Python and provides several important benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Reasons Why Strings Are Immutable in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Efficiency and Performance**:\n",
        "   - Strings are widely used in programming. Making them immutable allows Python to optimize their usage by sharing memory.\n",
        "   - For example, if multiple variables reference the same string, Python can safely reuse the same memory space, reducing memory usage and increasing performance.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     a = \"hello\"\n",
        "     b = \"hello\"\n",
        "     print(a is b)  # Output: True (same memory reference)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hashability**:\n",
        "   - Immutability allows strings to be **hashable**, which means their hash value does not change over their lifetime.\n",
        "   - This is crucial because strings are often used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in sets, both of which rely on hash values to function efficiently.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_dict = {\"key\": \"value\"}  # Strings as keys\n",
        "     print(my_dict[\"key\"])  # Output: value\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Thread Safety**:\n",
        "   - Strings are immutable, making them inherently thread-safe. Multiple threads can safely access the same string without the risk of one thread modifying it and causing unpredictable behavior in others.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Predictable Behavior**:\n",
        "   - Because strings cannot change, they behave predictably. Operations like slicing, concatenation, or replacement always return a new string rather than modifying the original, reducing potential bugs.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     s = \"hello\"\n",
        "     new_s = s.upper()  # Creates a new string\n",
        "     print(s)  # Output: hello (original string unchanged)\n",
        "     print(new_s)  # Output: HELLO\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Design Consistency**:\n",
        "   - Many programming languages treat strings as immutable (e.g., Java, C#). Python follows this convention to align with common programming practices and ensure consistency across environments.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Advantages of String Immutability**\n",
        "1. **Memory Optimization**:\n",
        "   - Python uses a technique called **string interning**, where frequently used strings are stored in a common pool to save memory. Immutability ensures these strings remain unchanged.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     a = \"hello\"\n",
        "     b = \"hello\"\n",
        "     print(id(a), id(b))  # Same memory address\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Safety and Security**:\n",
        "   - Immutable strings are less prone to unintended modifications, which is particularly useful when dealing with sensitive data like keys or passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Ease of Use**:\n",
        "   - Immutable strings simplify debugging and reasoning about code since their state cannot change unexpectedly.\n",

        "     s = \"hello\"\n",
        "     # s[0] = \"H\"  # Raises TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n",

        "### 📊 **1. Accessing an Element**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you access an element in a dictionary using its **key**, Python performs the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hash Function Calculation**:\n",
        "   - Python computes the **hash value** of the key to determine its location in memory.\n",
        "   - The hash function maps the key to an **index in the internal hash table**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Direct Lookup**:\n",
        "   - Python then looks up the element at the computed index in the hash table.\n",

        "- **Worst Case**: **O(n)** (Linear time, rare)\n",
        "  - In very rare cases, accessing an element might degrade to **O(n)** due to **hash collisions**.\n",
        "  - When multiple keys have the same hash value, Python uses **chaining or open addressing** to resolve these collisions, which may involve scanning multiple elements.\n",
